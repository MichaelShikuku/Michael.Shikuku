        <p id="bold">Hello, my name is Michael!</p>
        
        <p>I will be sharing my journey here that took me so far in technologies that I adopted to become a frontend & backend devoper. In addition, I will be sharing other things to give you a perspective here to help the community.

</p>

        <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
        <h6>Posted 11/11/2020</h6>
        
        <p>The purpose is to give you an idea about the landscape and to encourage you if you are feeling discouraged. Atleast, you should grow some understanding of what it takes to be a developer.

</p>


        <h2 id="quick-note">Quick Note</h2>
        <h6>Posted 11/11/2020</h6>
        
        <p>Don't feel overwhelmed while in the journey, you don't need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. 
If you think any of below infomation can be improved in any way, please do suggest.

</p>


        <h2 id="requirement">Requirement</h2>
        <h6>Posted 11/11/2020</h6>
        
        <p>Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Responsive Web Design is used in all types of modern web development.

To be effective as a developer, you should be proficient with the command line, know how to version control your code, and understand the fundamentals of the web.

        <h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
        <h6>Posted 11/11/2020</h6>
        
        <p>Before you dive into any of the paths, you should have a solid foundation in programming. For new developers, I highly recommend learning JavaScript as your first language. JS can be used for both frontend and backend developers which means you can become a fullstack developer while being able to focus on mastering only one language. The benefits of JavaScript are:
    <li>JavaScript is a relatively easy language to learn</li>
    <li>JavaScript is required to build web applications since it is the programming language that runs in the browser</li>
    <li>JavaScript can be used on the frontend and the backend, allowing you to write full-stack applications with a single language</li>
    <li>There are tons of jobs for JavaScript developers</li>

</p>

<p id="note">If you know that you either only want to work with data or exclusively on the backend, learning Python is the other option that is good for beginners.
</p>

<p>There are plenty of high-quality free options to get started with coding. khanacademy is excellent choices and great to set your foundation.   

</p> 

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <h6>Posted 11/11/2020</h6>
        
        <p>Once you have the basics down, a great next step is try to do real projects as quickly as possible. Projects are the best way to learn skills for the job and allow you to build a portfolio for when you start interviewing.
